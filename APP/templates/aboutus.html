            <h2>There is some information related our shop</h2>
            <p>Online shopping has been known as a rapidly growing business, and although online grocery shopping has not followed 
                these same growth patterns in the past, it is now being recognized for its potential. As such, 
                the focus of previous online shopping research has seldom encompassed this specific retail market, with 
                the existing studies focusing essentially on consumersâ€™ motivations and attitudes, rather than how consumers 
                actually shop for groceries online. Therefore, this dissertation has the objective of uncovering some of the details 
                of consumer decision making processes for this specific online retail market, details which can help further both academic 
                research and managerial knowledge.</p>
